      <h2 id="downtown">Downtown Austin eats</h2>
      <h3>Easy Tiger</h3>
      <p>Easy Tiger is a beer garten and bakery. They actually provide freshly baked bread to many of the best restaurants in the city! The upstairs provides great coffee (and pastries) to go, while the downstairs is a pub with an amazing beer selection, as well as delicious pretzels and sandwiches. We recommend their giant pretzel with beer cheese spread.</p>

      <h3>The Jackalope</h3>
      <p>This is your warning. The Jackalope is a total biker dive bar, but don't let that fool you. The Jackalope is home to some serious grub! Their burgers, with a side of waffle fries, are some of our favorites. They usually have a non-stop stream of B horror films, so this place may not be the best option for those with families tagging along.</p>
      <p><a class="small button" href="http://jackalopebar.com/">Go to The Jackalope</a></p>
      
      <h3>Turf N Surf Po' Boy</h3>
      <p>Yes, we have Po'Boys, and they are serious business. If you like a good po' boy, Turf N Surf Po' Boy is not to be missed. What started out as a trailer got so popular they opened up a brick and mortar inside Lavaca Street Bar, which means you can enjoy a beer with your delicious Po' Boy if you so choose. In addition to their delicious po' boys, we recommend their jalape√±o hush puppies.</p>

      <h3>Patika Coffee</h3>
      <p>Don't go to Starbucks. Just don't. Patika Coffee is, hands down, one of the best purveyors of coffee in downtown Austin. Each cup is prepared with love by a barista in this trailer located on 4th and Colorado, just a few blocks away from the Austin Convention Center.</p>
      <p><a class="small button" href="http://www.patikacoffee.com/">Go to Patika Coffee</a></p>

      <h3>Frank</h3>
      <p>Frank really has everything. Great coffee (to go, if you want!), great drinks, a good local beer selection, a bloody mary to die for, and great artisanal hot dogs. I know, artisanal hot dogs may sound a little hip, but do not fret. Frank is a great option for lunch and dinner, or even a late night snack (they're open late). We recommend you check out whatever weekly specials they have, if not, you can't go wrong with a Notorious P.I.G (a bacon-wrapped sausage with mac and cheese on top), or a Carolina Pork-It. Better yet, everything they serve can be made vegetarian or vegan!</p>
      <p><a class="small button" href="http://www.hotdogscoldbeer.com/">Go to Frank</a></p>

      <h3>Royal Blue Grocery</h3>
      <p>If you're looking for a solid place to grab a coffee or food to go, Royal Blue is a great option. With several locations in downtown Austin, Royal Blue can be a great place when you're looking for good food and are in a hurry. </p>

      <h3>The Whip In</h3>
      <p>What started as a convenience store with amazing beer selection turned into an Indian fusion restaurant with vegan and vegetarian friendly food, a nice patio, and live music in the evenings. If you have a car and can drive up a few minutes south of downtown, The Whip In is a must. Ask for their frito pie (not for the faint of heart, it's spicy!).</p> 
      <p><a class="small button" href="http://whipin.com/">Go to The Whip In</a></p>

      <h3>The Texas Chili Parlor</h3>
      <p>This is where Texas legislators eat while the legislation is in session. This is serious Texas chili made with brisket. We recommend their tamales smothered in chili, or their baked potato, also smothered in chili. They also have a vegetarian chili for those looking for veg-friendly fare.</p>
      <p><a class="small button" href="http://www.txchiliparlor.com/">Go to The Texas Chili Parlor</a></p>

      <h3>Juan in a Million</h3>
      <p>Breakfast tacos. If you've never had one, you should try Juan in a Million. Even Martha Stewart has eaten at this greasy spoon! You can even watch Juan in a Million on <a href="http://vimeo.com/2508259">Man v. Food</a> to prepare for this serious taco. We recommend their Don Juan, but if you're a breakfast taco beginner, a bacon, egg and cheese breakfast taco is probably a good starting point.</p>
      <p><a class="small button" href="http://www.juaninamillion.com/">Go to Juan in a Million</a></p>
 
      <h3>Shady Grove</h3>
      <p>If you're looking for a great patio, live outdoors music, and the happiest of happy hours, Shady Grove is an excellent option! Their queso is a must, and you can get it smothered on practically anything. Their chips and queso are a good starting place, though. We also highly recommend their margaritas, if you're looking for spirits.</p>
      <p><a class="small button" href="http://theshadygrove.com/">Go to Shady Grove</a></p>

      <h3>Threadgill's</h3>
      <p>Threadgill's is a little bit of an Austin tradition. What makes Threadgill's great is not only their outdoor patio (with live music for Sunday brunch!), but the fact you can get seconds on your sides. Let me say that again. You can get seconds on your sides. Double the mac and cheese, double the fun!</p>
      <p><a class="small button" href="http://www.threadgills.com/">Go to Threadgill's</a></p>

      <h3>Tamale House East</h3>
      <p>Tamale House East is where the hipsters brunch. But don't let that scare you off! Tamale House East is a great place for tamales, breakfast tacos, and coffee. I recommend asking for mole on your tamale, and washing it down with a Mexican iced coffee.</p>
      <p><a class="small button" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/tamale-house-east-austin">Go to Tamale House East</a></p>

      <h3>Uncommon Objects</h3>
      <p>Talk about keeping Austin weird. Uncommon Objects is the thrift store to end all thrift stores. Their highly curated selection of antiques includes anything from vintage belt buckles, to vintage cameras, boots, and more. If you like thrifting or finding a unique vintage item, Uncommon Objects is not to be missed.</p>
      <p><a class="small button" href="http://www.uncommonobjects.com/">Go to Uncommon Objects</a></p>

      <h3>Waterloo Records</h3>
      <p>Waterloo Records is an Austin tradition. If you love music, Waterloo Records is a great place to find anything from the newest music releases, to whatever is hot in the current Austin indie music scene. Plus they have a decent selection of vinyl.</p>
      <p><a class="small button" href="http://www.waterloorecords.com/">Go to Waterloo Records</a></p>

      <h3>Lucy in Disguise with Diamonds</h3>
      <p>It's not just the amazing pun. Lucy in Disguise with Diamonds is an Austin institution as the go-to Austin costume shop. Though you're probably not looking to rent a costume for DrupalCon, Lucy in Disguise does offer more than costume rentals. They have costumes for sale, as well as other props and fun things. Or you may just want to check it out just for the experience.</p>

      <h3>Dragon's Lair</h3>
      <p>If you have a car at your disposal, like board games and comics, and don't mind the 20 minute drive up to North Austin, you should absolutely make a trip to Dragon's Lair. Comics, comics, comics, plus a great selection of high-quality board games, both indie and from well-known brands. If minifigs are also your fancy, you will enjoy their selection of role playing fare.</p>

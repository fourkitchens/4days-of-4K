# Contributing to 4 days of 4K

Some web fonts are hosted using the [typography.com](http://typography.com) service. This means the fonts are only visable on whitelisted URLs like `github.io`. You can see them locally by using software like MAMP to change to the local server to something like `4days.local` (which is whitelisted).
